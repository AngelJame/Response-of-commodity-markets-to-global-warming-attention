# <p align="center">Response of commodity markets to global warming attention</p>

## 1.Data
  
(1) `Commodity daily prices.xlsx` records daily prices of 23 commodities including Cocco, Coffee, Corn, etc. from *Datastream database*.  
  
(2) `Commdity weekly prices.xlsx` records weekly price data for commodities, which is composed by filtering daily prices every Friday from `Commdity daily prices.xlsx`. The return of commodity markets in the papers' Table 2 are calculated based on this data through equation (2)ã€‚  

(3) `Global abnormal attention index.xlsx` records the global abnormal surface temperature from *Berkeley Earth Temperature (https://berkeleyearth.org/data/)*.  

(4) `Global warming attention index` records the internet search index of topic 'global warming' from *Google Trend (https://trends.google.com/trends)*.  

(5) `Related topics weekly index.xlsx` records the internet search index of ten topics closely related to global warming from *Google Trend (https://trends.google.com/trends)*. Ten topcis are  greenhouse effect, greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, heat wave, extreme weather, ocean acidification,  sea level rise, water scarcity, climate change adaptation, climate change mitigation.  

(6) `Weekly control variables.xlsx` records weekly data of four control variables, including Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (gepu), the Index of Global Real Economic Activity (igrea), nominal exchange rate index (exchange), and the Geopolitical Risk Index (gpr).  

## 2.Code    
### Volatility calculation    

(1) `Volatility Calculation.R` is an R language program that calculates the volatility of the commodity markets, the data needed for this program is */Data/Commdity daily prices.xlsx*.   

### Market uncertainty calculation code    

The calculation of the commodity market uncertainty (UNC) involves two steps. The first step uses a generalised dynamic factor model (GDFM) to remove the predictable factors in the commodity markets from commodity returns. This step obtains the residuals of commodity returns over different periods, representing the unique volatility behaviour of the return of a particular commodity. Considering the time-varying characteristics of returns, the second step adopts the Monte Carlo method to estimate the stochastic volatility model. This captures the random walk characteristics of returns, resulting in the commodity market uncertainty index.  
    
#### Generalised Dynamic Factor model  
  
(1) `day_return.xlsx` is the daily commodity market returns, which is summarized by `/Data/Commodity daily prices.xlsx`.  

(2) Firstly, we import `day_return.xlsx` into **Matlab software** in the numerical matrix format.  

(3) Secondly, `numfactors.m` is used to obtain the relationship (see the following figure) between the number of dynamic factors and information criteria by setting the threshold value of q_max=10, and using the default settings for the rest of parameters. The q-value (red curve) corresponding to the second interval where Sc (blue curve) is 0 is the optimal number of dynamic factors. Therefore, the optimal number of dynamic factors is 1 in this work.

(4) Thirdly, `Launch.m` is used to obtain the optimal number of static factors. We set threshold kmax as 10, and the number of static factors is determined to be 5 based on the PC1 or PC2 information criteria.  

#### Stochastic Volatility model  
  
### GMM-PVAR model  
(1) `pvar2014.zip` is the necessary Stata package to implement the GMM-PVAR model. We need to download and extract it to the installation directory of the Stata software.     

(2) `GMM-PVAR`
